# MATHS_GPT_PROJECT
Text to Math Problem Solver and Data Search Assistant

This project is a Streamlit application that combines advanced reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and data retrieval capabilities. It uses the LangChain framework and Groq API to handle complex tasks such as solving mathematical problems, performing logical reasoning, and searching for information on Wikipedia.

**Features**

**Mathematical Problem Solving:**
Handles simple to complex mathematical expressions.
Provides detailed, step-by-step explanations.

**Reasoning and Logic:**
Capable of answering logic-based questions and generating well-reasoned responses.

**Data Search:**
Integrates with Wikipedia to fetch accurate information on various topics.

**Interactive Chat Interface:**
Chat-like interface for seamless user interaction.

**Groq API Integration:**
Powered by the Gemma2-9b-It model for enhanced reasoning and computation.

**Workflow**

- The app initializes tools (Calculator, Wikipedia Search, Reasoning).
  
- It uses LangChain agents to dynamically select and apply the appropriate tool(s) for your question.
  
- Results are displayed in an easy-to-read format in the chat interface.
